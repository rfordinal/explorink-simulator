// Shim for NimBLE's NimBLECharacteristic and its callback interface.
//
// The characteristic is a value plus a subscription plus a callback pointer.
// All three live in this object; SimBleGatt is a friend and owns the mutex
// that guards them, because the reader thread, the host thread and the
// activity thread all touch them.
//
// **Callback dispatch is never inline.** onWrite, onStatus and onSubscribe are
// called by SimBleGatt's host thread, never by the client op that caused them
// and never by indicate(). See docs/ble-shim.md, "Threading model".

// Real NimBLE spells these as a namespace of constants, so a firmware
// expression like `WRITE | NOTIFY | INDICATE` is an integer. Values are
// NimBLE's own, so a props number in an emitted `gatt` event means the same
// thing here as in a NimBLE header.
//
// Read off the pinned NimBLE host, not from memory -- `BLE_GATT_CHR_F_*` in
// nimble/host/include/host/ble_gatt.h:130-145. Only the four the firmware uses
// are declared. In particular 0x0001 is **broadcast**, not read: read is
// 0x0002 (ble_gatt.h:133), and standard GATT agrees, so this is not a NimBLE
// quirk. A shim carrying broadcast's bit under the name READ would tell a
// client "broadcast" wherever the device meant "read".
